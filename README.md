# UnovanModmail
This is the code for Unovan Modmail.
Config file should probably exist. 
check the start of index.js to see what should be in it. 
nvm imma make a template here. 

{
    "bot_token": "Bot token ofc",
    "config_owner": "the user id that owns this bot",
    "prefix": "&",
    "hd": "----",
    "ServerID": "the server id",
    "hj": "----"
}

once u done go install the node packages needed with 'npm i'
